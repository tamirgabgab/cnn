# cnn

Image classification based on CNN.


## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. <br>

## Model
CNN with single Convolution block and single linear block

## Train + Test
here are 50k training images and 10k test images. (0.83/0.17 split) <br>

69.33% Accuracy on 10k samples

## Error prediction samples
16 random samples chosen as an example to show how the model misclassifies <br>
